# Sentiment-Analysis
In this project the method of Sentiment Analysis is performed over 2500 Twitter dataset using Twitter API.Sentiment Analysis is the automated process of determining whether a text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral opinion about a product or topic. Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and algorithms, including:
<li> Rules-Based Systems: Using a set of manually crafted rules
<li> Automatic systems: Rely on machine learning techniques to learn from data
<li> Hybrid systems: Combine both rule-based and automatic approaches
Performing sentiment analysis, can save you time, effort, and resources when analyzing your survey responses. It’s far more efficient than manually sorting data because it’s completely automated, meaning your team can focus on more urgent and important tasks.
